<p>Consumers are changing how they shop and what they expect from brands. That’s why we worked with Martin’s® Famous Pastry Shoppe to create opportunities for its potato bread lines in grocery stores, online and at special events.</p>
<p>We introduced Martin’s to Kunzler Meats after identifying that both brands shared core values, brand persona attributes and flavor profiles that made for the perfect co-marketing match. The results: Doubled sales for both brands during the campaign.</p>

<div class="grid-6 about-the-project">
<div class="small-wrap-left">
<p><span class="pbold">We’ve helped Martin’s</span> establish a solid plan for growing market share. Here’s what we did.</p>

<p><span class="pbold">We sought to understand</span> audience behavior through focus groups and working with the executive team to build an effective channel strategy. We studied shopper habits to create key target profiles that were used to build an action-driving sales and marketing plan. Our team then got right to work. We worked with Martin’s to pursue trade and institutional sales with the launch of a trade show booth that stayed true to the brand’s mom-and-pop-style persona but was a food star on the show floor.
</p>

<p><span class="pbold">More Likes, shares and brand recognition</span> are important parts of a successful social marketing effort. To achieve those goals, our team developed a campaign titled #MartinsFamous that lived across multiple social networks. The campaign drove brand recognition among target consumers, built an online audience and diversified consumers’ understanding of the product, by encouraging consumers to tell their own #MartinsFamous story.
</p>

<p><span class="pbold">Dominating the shopping cart</span> doesn’t happen in a day, and for a growing brand with key geographic regions in sight, managing regional consumer trends can create speed, efficiency and increased ROI as its distribution network expands. For Martin’s, Philadelphia was a key territory that was a gateway to other markets.
Our team identified and recommended key opportunities, including sponsoring the Broad Street Run in Philadelphia.
