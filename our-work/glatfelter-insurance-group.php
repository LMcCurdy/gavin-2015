<div class="small-wrap-left">
	<p><span class="pbold">Working in conjunction</span> with the Glatfelter team, we transformed complex industry topics and selling points into digestible content and campaigns that would resonate with their unique target audiences across 5 different divisions.
</p>

<p><span class="pbold">Niche audiences</span> want to feel understood.  With this in mind, for VFIS we coordinated a photoshoot with lifestyle scenarios geared toward firefighters.  The photos were used for ad campaigns and website imagery,helping to stretch the budget further and create a cohesive look across various media.</p>

<p><span class="pbold">Taking great website design</span> a step further, a good look is meaningless without a solid SEO platform behind it.  If your audience can’t find your beautiful website, it’s pretty much a moot point. Right?</p>
<p><span class="pbold">Starting with SEO</span> best practices, we designed sites catering to each segmented audience. This meant keyword research from five different points of view, as well as designing an interface that could be easily navigated by each audience.</p>
