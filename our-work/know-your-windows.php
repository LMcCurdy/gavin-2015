<div class="grid-6 about-the-project">
<div class="small-wrap-left">
<p><span class="pbold">We developed</span> a digital marketing campaign designed to include a landing page built for conversion, a video series catered to consumer education and product knowledge, and pay per click advertising to maximize reach and awareness. We collaborated with the experts behind KnowYourWindows.com to deliver a campaign that continues to drive brand awareness and generate leads. 
</p>

<p><span class="pbold">The KnowYourWindows.com </span>landing page became the second largest traffic driver to AVI Marvin’s website. 
Lead generation increased through video content that covered topics relating to the exceptional difference and product offerings behind AVI Marvin. 
The brand became successfully positioned as consumer advocates, craftsmen and trusted experts in the region with targeted social and online advertising. 
</p>

<p><span class="pbold">Analyzing the campaign’s </span> historic performance in Google Analytics and Adwords month over month and year over year, keeps the campaign fresh for unique users as well as repeat visitors through ongoing SEO efforts, A/B testing ads/adgroups, and constantly reevaluating lead generation opportunities with consumer, value-added incentives. 
What is proven to work best today will not always be the best practice tomorrow, because user behavior is ever dynamic. Which is why our approach to digital marketing campaigns strives for continuous improvement. Repeating the process of implementation and analysis is key to ongoing success.
