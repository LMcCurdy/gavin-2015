<div class="grid-6 about-the-project">
<div class="small-wrap-left">
	<p><span class="pbold">As part our support</span> of Trespa, we developed a comprehensive marketing plan that served as a solid foundation for sales growth and provided a strategic plan to increase communication across all teams — even across the Atlantic Ocean with the parent company, Trespa International. Armed with this road map, we worked with the entire Trespa team, from sales and marketing to education and compliance, to gain market influence and brand awareness that drives sales.</p>

<p><span class="pbold">Our work with Trespa</span> is expansive, including trade show marketing, communications management, sales materials, video case studies, public relations, email marketing and ongoing consulting to address opportunities in real time.</p>

<p><span class="pbold">The results</span> went far beyond moving architectural panels. We were able to help move the entire channel toward brand buy-in, ultimately resulting in a multiplier effect. As our team established improved marketing consistencies that supported targeted sales segments and geographic opportunity creation, Trespa’s partners wanted to invest more time, energy and support to build the brand and sales.</p>
