<p>Our team managed the total rebranding of TrueNorth Wellness Services, formerly known as Adams Hanover Counseling Services, taking our client from name development all the way through brand identity and building brand buy-in.

<div class="grid-6 about-the-project">
<div class="small-wrap-left">
	<p><span class="pbold">After extensive discovery,</span> our team launched the TrueNorth Wellness rebrand with an authentic message to overcome challenges in communicating to internal and external audiences. We removed the complexity from the communications of their wellness and health care programs to deliver clear, targeted outreach to various audiences.</p>

<p><span class="pbold">We identified</span> and engaged brand ambassadors to establish a plan that all employees felt a part of, reinforced through integrated internal campaigns that provided tools on how to talk about the rebrand.</p>

<p><span class="pbold">An open feedback loop</span> between employees and management encouraged widespread employee buy-in, essential for a smooth transition. Internal email marketing drove home brand values and equipped staff with the language to clearly communicate with clients and the community.</p>
<p><span class="pbold">From the start,</span> we incorporated this authentic message into public relations and media outreach to tell the story of the new brand persona and reinforce awareness of TrueNorth Wellnessâ€™ services among external audiences. In just 10 months of launching the new brand, our team helped TrueNorth Wellness gain an influential position in the regional health care market, launching new partnerships and collaborations and increasing client program use and inquiries across the board.</p>
