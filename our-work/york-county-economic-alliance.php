<div class="grid-6 about-the-project">
<div class="small-wrap-left">
<p><span class="pbold">Our team tackled</span> all the complexities that a membership organization faces when overhauling its digital presence, including how to best integrate customer relationship management (CRM) systems for improved efficiencies and retention opportunities.</p> 

<p><span class="pbold">For YCEA</span> and many other chamber organizations, Chamber Master is the go-to system for membership benefits management. We collaborated with the <a href="http://www.chambermaster.com/" target="_blank">Chamber Master</a> system’s team to carry our designs across their user interface and deliver an easy-to-navigate and easy-to-manage system for members and YCEA staff.</p>

<p><span class="pbold">With multiple audiences</span> visiting YCEA’s website for a wide array of reasons, the organization needed to make sure the site properly funneled visitors to the right pages quickly. Paring down the content and improving SEO increased organic search results and creates a more positive overall user experience.</p>

<p><span class="pbold">The results are more than</span> just a well-designed site: By getting each unique visitor where he or she wants to be with the fewest clicks possible, our team developed a tool that ultimately drives membership and partner opportunities. </p>
