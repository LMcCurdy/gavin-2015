<div class="grid-6 about-the-project">
<div class="small-wrap-left">
<p><span class="pbold">It started with</span> the idea that beauty is recognized from the inside out. </p>

<p><span class="pbold">Our team developed</span> and implemented a strategic campaign that reinforced Lèbo as the leading skin care expert in the region. Patients already understood Lèbo’s role in skin care as a treatment provider and an expert in the industry. It was time to get the audience involved. </p>

<p><span class="pbold">Lèbo Beautiful</span> is a yearlong beauty campaign designed to produce user-generated content, grow social media fan bases and increase brand awareness. To incentivize users to join the campaign conversation, we created a monthly hashtag giveaway prompting users to tell us what makes them feel beautiful. Users tagged their posts with #LeboBeautiful to be automatically entered to win an exclusive Lèbo Beautiful Kit filled with Lèbo’s best-selling products and merchandise. </p>

<p><span class="pbold">In addition,</span> we created a grand prize giveaway that users could enter through an online entry portal. The grand prize? A makeover worth $1,500! </p>

<p><span class="pbold">All told,</span> the campaign has generated more than 1,300 Likes on Facebook, increased engagement through hashtag education and broadened the brand’s reach throughout the region.</p>
