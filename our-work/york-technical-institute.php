<div class="small-wrap-left">
	<p><span class="pbold">Our public relations</span> strategy for YTI Career Institute is built on communication and responsiveness. Frequent face-to-face meetings with campus directors and their teams allow us to dig in and find the people, events and stories that reporters and editors want to cover – whether it’s father-daughter culinary students in Lancaster or a profile of a recent dental assisting graduate in York.</p>

<p><span class="pbold">Our work doesn’t stop</span> when the press coverage is secured; that’s when we’re just getting started. Gavin’s PR team is made up of former journalists who work with our clients to develop clear, concise messaging and get the most out of every media interaction.</p>
<p><span class="pbold">Talking to the media</span> can be intimidating. That’s why we’re there with YTI before, during and after every story, telling them what to expect and answering questions as they arise. The results speak for themselves. With 192 press clips generating 39,128,519 impressions in 2014, YTI Career Institute continues to benefit from Gavin’s hands-on approach to public relations.</p>
<p><span class="pbold">After working with Gavin</span> for two years, YTI’s parent company, Porter and Chester Institute, with nine campuses in Connecticut and Massachusetts, released its New York City public relations agency and named Gavin its public relations agency of record for all of its campuses.</p>
